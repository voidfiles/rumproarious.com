<p>I have had a fun few days processing the input I have recived about <em><a href='http://www.rumproarious.com/2012/01/31/rss-needs-a-new-pr-team/'>RSS needs better PR</a></em>. I encourage everyone to keep the feedback coming. I would also like to announce that I am going to open this blog to other authors. If you would like to write a post just let me know. I am sure we can figure out something.</p>

<p>Some great comments so far.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So what is this new medium? It sounds like a conversation to be had. Let&#8217;s have it! I couldn&#8217;t live without RSS, I get all of my information via RSS, Twitter and FB are just noise to me. Whenever I find something come through my tweet stream I find interesting, it&#8217;s not long after that I get it through a feed. I&#8217;m with you, I want to see the new breed of &#8220;RSS&#8221;, and I am willing to have the conversation with anyone about what that may be. <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;- Anthony Schultz</p>

<p>That is a good point, what is the new medium. I think it&#8217;s a good idea to go a little more indepth into what I mean by a medium, and what this new medium actually is.</p>

<p>Just an idea: bring JSON into the mix. We need JSON-based &#8220;feeds&#8221; for stuff that&#8217;s primarily data (for which I other wise might provide a &#8220;download spreadsheet&#8221; link). Like it or not &#8220;API&#8221; is off-putting to non-devs and devs fail to see &#8220;feeds&#8221; as easy-to-use APIs (which, of course, they are). A JSON-based version of RSS would start getting folks to see the similarities. AND it&#8217;d be trival to allow arbitrary JSON in the equvalent of atom:content in the JSON-based feed. Lots of cool apps would result. <br />&#160;&#160;&#160;- Peter Keane</p>

<p>I like the idea of weaning our selves off of Atom, and RSS. We do need to realize that if there is an API, there is probably a way to get data out. I suppose this will mean we need better swis army knife tools that can be used by a wide number of people though.</p>
