<p>So, it happened. Google Reader has forever changed. I am the one that always makes fun of normies when they complain about Facebook changing. I am sure that I can learn to use it even now. So, while I am totally butt hurt about this whole process. I think there are two standout problems that could be fixed quickly.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The design of the story area is sad. I can&#8217;t tell where it begins, and ends.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>What the fuck happened to shift-s Just hook it up to something, but to turn it off completely is crazy.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>What I am afraid of is that this changes are there to slightly throw off the hard core users. So we will leave. Then they can shut down reader quietly in a year, when we have all adopted something else.</p>

<p>There are two competing alternatives to Google Reader right now. <a href='http://newsblur.org'>Newsblur</a>, and <a href='http://hivemined.org/'>HiveMined</a>. HiveMined has the social, and a commitment to a Google Reader like experience. Newsblur has the new hotness and is open source. I almost wish they would merge, and make a super team.</p>

<p>I publicly offer to help anyone who wants to build a Google Reader Alternative. I can do server stuff, I can do server side programming, I can do front-end.</p>
