[Feedbin.me](https://feedbin.me/) has released the code that runs the service as [open source](http://blog.feedbin.me/2013/08/27/feedbin-is-open-source/), checkout out the [Github](https://github.com/feedbin/feedbin). It joins [Newsblur](https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur) as being the second large for profit RSS reader to release its code in such a manner. I'm not aware of any other commercial services that open source all of their code.

This seems like a strong move that only a independent developer can take when faced with competition from well funded competitors. Being a 1 or 2 person team you can't fight head-to-head with a Feedly or a Digg without doing something a little guerrilla. Open sourcing code makes a ton of sense in this case.
