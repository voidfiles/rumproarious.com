I have been threatening to do this for a while, and now I have. I created a mini-ebook about the future of feed readers. I used many of the blog posts that I wrote over the last few weeks as the raw material for it, but I tried to craft a solid narrative for the ebook. Check it out:

[Feeding Our Reading Habits](http://rumproarious.com/feeding-our-reading-habits/)

Also available in [PDF](http://www.rumproarious.com/feeding-our-reading-habits/feeding_our_reading_habits.pdf) and for the [Kindle](http://www.amazon.com/Feeding-Our-Reading-Habits-ebook/dp/B00DKD41CM/).
