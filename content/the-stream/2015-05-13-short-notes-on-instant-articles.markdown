Instant articles are cool. They look nice, at least the NatGeo one does.

This is a much better reading experience then the average article, especially on mobile.

It's a little weird that Facebook effectively owns the "TV" of mobile content.

That being said, Facebook just defined the "Instant Articles" market. If people in general like that experience other apps can capitalize on this new market. Some app could unbundle that experience from Facebook.

Although, Facebook could this them selves. That's probably what Paper is.

They could even force people to use Paper, just like they forced people to use Messanger.

This is a win for reading, a win for short-term distribution. Could be scary in the long term. Only time will tell.
