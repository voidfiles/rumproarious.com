Brent Simmons created a [mailing list](http://inessential.com/2013/03/17/rss-sync_mailing_list) to talk about any new potential RSS syncing services.

> "I created a new mailing list for people who want to talk about the technical side of RSS syncing.

> Ideally there would be a single standard for RSS syncing, and clients could choose among systems. But I don’t insist on that — at least not yet. I think it’s ambitious enough just to get some working sync systems up and running." - [Brent Simmons](http://inessential.com/2013/03/17/rss-sync_mailing_list)

No matter what happens, I always love when RSS is "threatened". Everyone comes out to shake off their well worn rugs to demonstrate that, yes, RSS is really a well used, and loved technology.
