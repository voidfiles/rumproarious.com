As an engineer, it's possible in your career to move from role to role without a rigorous assessment. If you chose companies whose values are in conflict with your own you are hurting your effectiveness. I also fell into this trap for most of my career.

You can make a deliberate choice though. You can build a system to evaluate your choices. One system is to write down your values and then compare your choices to your values. If you feel that a company or organization shares your values, your chances of being effective should go up. 

While it's impossible to make the perfect choice each time, knowing the tradeoffs you made will help you evaluate your experience in the future.

The last time I moved companies I decided to write down my values and use them when deciding where I wanted to go next.

For what it's worth, in my current role at Stitch Fix I feel like I've found a good fit.

## Experimentation

Face it, most things we try for the first time don't work quite right. That is the nature of trying new things. But, trying things are how we adapt. Given that the world is rapidly changing, the only way we can keep up is to try lots of new things, constantly. Therefore I highly value experimentation especially the kind that leads to failure as it is the best teacher.

Any choice I make needs to embrace experimentation. It should increase space for failure. It should enable learning from failure.

## Learning

Learning is, in part, the output of the experimentation process. I want to reserve time and space for expanding my knowledge. Learning is also different from experimentation, because you can learn in many ways. I want to embrace as many ways as possible.

If your position keeps you so busy working on feature delivery that you can't take time to learn something new, It's possible you aren't at the right company.

This is also where I hear folks say, "I learn by working on my side projects". Not everyone can or wants to work on side projects. You shouldn't have to spend time outside of work to learn how to be better at your job.

## Vision && Strategy

There should be a clear vision for the future. We should know where we are, but where we are going as well. Acknowledgment that things will change seems appropriate if you embrace experimentation and learning.

There should be a clear understanding of how we fit into the world currently. We should understand how we are uniquely suited to help our customers.

Along with having a clear long term vision, I want to understand how we are going to get there. It's easy to declare the desired outcomes, it's not as easy to explain how you will get there.

## Inclusion

It's imperative that any organization create a system where the best ideas can be heard and acted upon.

I truly believe that the best idea or winning strategy can come from anywhere. Often though folks with those ideas aren't heard or don't feel like they can speak. For instance, if you have a bunch of folks who are trying to win an argument instead of finding a way to the best outcome, that can shut out folks who aren't sure of their idea. How could they possibly win, if the idea is nascent, instead there should be space for idea development.

I find that when you can allow space for influence you'll be more likely to hear it and understand it and build on it.

## Diversity

Diversity is strength, it sustains, and it's healthy. It may cause conflict, but that conflict is a healthy process that should lead to a more full understanding of the problems your organization deals with.

## Accessibility

I want to enable many different kinds of people to effortlessly use the things I make. 

## Affordance

I want people who use what I make to be delighted at the possibilities of the tools. I want to enable their wildest dreams, and I want to support their goals, not mine.
