In my professional roles the word engineer is in the title somewhere. For instance I'm currently a Principal Engineer at Stitch Fix, but I've been a Software Engineer, Front-end Engineer and so fourth over the years. The word engineer isn't really apt for what I do though. In the last year I found a new promising word: [Symmathecist](https://medium.com/@jessitron/symmathecist-n-c728957ce71f).

I learned about it from this post "[The Origins of Opera and the Future of Programming](https://blog.atomist.com/the-origins-of-opera-and-the-future-of-programming/)" by [Jessica Kerr](https://twitter.com/jessitron). 

> A symmathesy (sim-MATH-uh-see, coined by Nora Bateson) is a learning system made of learning parts. Software teams are each a symmathesy, composed of the people on the team, the running software, and all their tools.

You should read the post about how this related to opera.
