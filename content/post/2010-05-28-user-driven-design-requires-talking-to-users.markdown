title: User Driven Design, Requires Talking To Users
wordpress_id: '58'
---

I have made a number of websites, small and large. I would say that
[wacchen](http://wacchen.com), is my fifth large project "launch". I
take that word "launch" with a grain of salt because this time I have
done almost no fanfare. I just started by sharing things on my blog, and
twitter.

People have started to show up, about 8 of them so far. That is fine by
me, this is actually a great little rollout. Then the other day I
realized that because there were so few, I could just ask them straight
out, what do you want, what is broken? They have responded, and I got
straight answers.

I have always wanted to do user driven design but for some reason asking
the users never came to mind. I will probably do more publicity for the
site at some point, but right now I feel like I have just enough users
to polish something.

I would like to thank some of the people who have really helped me so
far.

-   [Chris Klarmann](http://twitter.com/wery67564) - using chrome on
    linux, not something I do everyday.
-   [Mathew James](http://www.google.com/profiles/praisewillard) - is
    actual an old friend. He has been giving me bug reports about
    inconsisitant behavior.
-   [Jack Mottram](http://onethingwell.org/) - Runs a website about
    simple sites, and products. My stuff was broken in the beginning on
    his setup, and he stuck with it till it was fixed. I hope that my
    site fits the requirement for being on his site.
-   [papyromancer](http://twitter.com/papyromancer) - Is just an awesome
    feedback giver. He has helped give me feedback on my other site,
    [http://staytuned.in](http://staytuned.in), and he is continuing on
    this one too.
