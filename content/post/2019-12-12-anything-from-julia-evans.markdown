It's not often that anyone can take up basic linux literacy and make it interesting, but Julia Evans[^julia-evans] does it with style. Here is her zine on pipes[^zines]:

She doesn't just illuminate linux, she will often bring that same clarity to more advanced topics such as service discovery. Here is a zine from a blog post [^consul] she wrote on Stripes engineering blog.

So, checkout the zines, or one of her many posts on kubernetes or networking and learn something.
