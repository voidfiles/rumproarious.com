The infrastructure of my productivity is a set of tools that revolve around plain text files. Try as I might it doesn't work any other way.

I've tried tools with more "stuff" in them. Often when I try and import my modest[^modest] set of files they grind to a halt. So, I go back to my tried and true tools.

I'm thankful they exist and continue to work. It's a patchwork of folks and tools that keep this stuff running. 

Check out their tools. Pay for them if you can. Read their stuff for interesting tips. It's all worth it.
