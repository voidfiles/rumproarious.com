Writing down remediation items is a seductively simple outcome for a post-mortem. It’s satisfying. Yea, there was an issue but if we do these 3 things, we will be better off. It’s all wrapped up in a nice bow. Although remediation feels like the right outcome, it’s not the most powerful reason to do a post-mortem. The most valuable part of a post-mortem is the ability to radiate expertise into your organization.
 
This feels counter-factual. Why, if our organization is expert, did it fail?

Expertise is similar to the future. It’s at your organization, but it’s not evenly distributed.  This might make a little more sense. If your experience is anything like mine my day is made up mostly of trying to get things done. Learning is important, but I can’t spend my whole day learning, I’ve got to produce something of value after all. So, I work, we all do, and through our work we learn, sometimes we learn without fully articulating what we’ve learned. This leads to pools of expertise that have a hard time flowing into other parts of your organization, often because folks can’t articulate it.
 
It’s not uncommon for expertise to be hard to explain.

We don’t find it just in diagnosing, what about baking chocolate chip cookies, knowing when it’s going to rain, or tiling while making a ski turn. These are all expert things, that are subconscious at times. Just because our work can be technical at times doesn’t mean that we don’t develop unexplained reactions to technical phenomena.
 
I’ll bet you already do this. Imagine for a moment, you open your laptop and turn on Slack, or your organization's internal chat mechanism. I’ll be you might already have a sense of what’s going on based on the number and nature of notifications you see. Your body is probably reacting to it before your mind catches up.
 
I know for some of you I might even have triggered a sense of anxiety, notifications for some folks mean a problem. I’m sorry, I’ve been there.
 
This is why the “New View” on safety is so important, and why [Etsy's Debriefing Facilitation Guide](/notes/debriefing-facilitation-guide/) is such a brilliant document. It makes blameless postmortems attainable.
 
By letting safety and learning guide these discussions, you can begin to unearth the tacit knowledge in your organization that is siloed. When you begin to learn from the experts in your company you will radiate that expertise. You can begin to systematize expertise, and I think most importantly you can find what is limiting the capacity of individuals in your organization thus creating a virtuous cycle of individual capacity increase.
