I have been really impressed with the coverage of the javascript
community over at [DailyJS](http://dailyjs.com). So, when they were
asking for guest bloggers I jumped at the chance. I chose to write about
an idea that has started to surface which is mobile data sync. Sync can
be tricky especially when you mix in the fact that mobile devices can be
offline for long periods of time. I tried to find a solution, but
couldn't find anything. That is why I wrote the article I wanted to see
if could kick up some dust and create a conversation. [Check it
out](http://dailyjs.com/2010/09/03/mobile-sync/).
