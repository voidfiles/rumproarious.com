title: Published An Article On The YUI Blog

I just published an
[article](https://web.archive.org/web/20100601091906/http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2010/05/27/yui3-intro-to-offline/)
on the YUI Blog. I have been working at
Yahoo! for almost 3 years now. 1 year as an intern, more like an
"intern", after about 3 months I just started working like a normal
person, but was still in school so I had to be classified as an
"intern".

I have enjoyed more of my time at Yahoo, then not, and I think that
Yahoo has a lot of really cool things going on. I have met some of the
smartest developers I have ever worked with inside of Yahoo, and there
is a lot of technical brilliance here. Yahoo just needs to figure out
how to unleash it upon the world. Fear not, I am working on it.

I am very proud, and excited to represent Yahoo on the [YUI
Blog](http://www.yuiblog.com), and by the way if you are looking for a
job we are hiring.

From the article. Its about offline HTML5 apps.

> I could say that HTML5 is building steam, but that time is passed:
> HTML5 is here. Mobile is already huge, WebKit is growing rapidly, and
> the number of people who will have an HTML5-capable browser on their
> phone and/or laptop over the next few years will create a “new normal”
> in which HTML5 capabilities are the standard.
>
> One of the awesome features in HTML5 is the Application Cache, which
> gives websites the ability to tell the browser which files to cache
> and to use the cached files when the browser doesn’t have a network
> connection. You can use the Application Cache to ensure that a user
> will be able to access at least part of your app while he is offline.
> In the case of devices like phones or tablets (or even old-fashioned
> devices like laptops), this could mean that your users are able to use
> your app while on an airplane. Meanwhile, you get to continue building
> your app with web technologies rather than learning Objective-C.
