As a senior engineer working on a core engineering or platform team it’s easy to wait and react to the biggest pain points in your organization or to behave as an organizational backstop. Although working that way can be highly visible and it can feel like you are doing valuable work, you might be missing out on an opportunity to lead your organization into the future. 

Being a backstop, or being highly reactive to organization friction might be right for your org. If you are in a life over limb situation, stop the bleeding, but eventually you have to get out of fire fighting routine. Or you are setting yourself and your team up for burnout.

Instead,  your impact should be creating long term strategic investments that unlock future potential. In general, I think the goal of core/platform teams should be to help your co-workers deliver valuable work to your customers with speed, efficiency, and quality.

Using that as a mission,  is paramount to delivering value outside of reacting.  Unfortunately, you won’t have the luxury of being told what to do. Fortunately, you’ll have an amazing team, with loads of experience. To integrate your experience into a consistent value proposition, you’ll have to hold each other accountable to the mission.

Most likely, you were chosen for your role because of your track record. People are looking for you to wrestle with the big ideas and work as a team to build an amazingly powerful engineering organization.
 

## Turning Qualitative Experience Into Data

Once you’ve settled on a mission, you’ll need to deliver on that mission. Clearly, one way you do that is by choosing projects to work on that will make an impact on your organization.

The value of those projects might stem from your intuition. Through your experience, you’ll have a sense that  your projects will improve the experience of the developers you work with. But, often there is a gap between your intuition and the way the business would like to measure your impact.

The business is looking for material impact on KPIs. It’s often hard to connect platform/core work to the KPIs that drive the business.  In the best of times it can feel like you are saying, trust us.

Other times though, you might hear folks talk about “word-smithing” technical investments so they are palatable to your business partners.

I’m wary of word-smithing in this context or “selling” the work. It seems to suggest that you have to perform some kind of misdirection to do valuable work. Instead you can talk about the difficult and complex nature of improving organizational performance.

In fact, there is research to suggest that we need something more than a quantatative process.

> “Many in the software industry recognize that software development also presents a number of unique management and organizational issues that need to be addressed and solved in order for the field to progress. And this situation has led to studies related not only to software engineering technical issues, but also to non-technical issues as well as to the intersection between the technical and non-technical aspects. Complex software engineering issues can be difficult to study using a purely quantitative approach.“ - [Qualitative research in software engineering](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-011-9163-y)  

While software engineering is a young discipline, we can borrow techniques from other disciplines to find our way.

For instance, there is a whole field of work that focuses on qualitative research into quantitive data.  There is a paper,  [Using thematic analysis in psychology](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1191/1478088706QP063OA) , that has over 80k citations. (Thematic analysis is a way to perform a qualitative analysis.)

Furthermore qualitative analysis is the scientific underpinning of books like [Accelerate](https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339), and the [Yearly DORA State of Devops Report](https://www.devops-research.com/research.html). 

You are probably already doing things like blameless post-mortems. And, analyzing post-mortem trends. That is also a kind of qualitative analysis.

Lastly, you are probably already performing qualitative analysis. Every day you listen to your co-workers, you find the similarities in their stories, and you use that to gauge where to invest your time.

Even though you might do that as an individual, when you work in a team it’s even more important that you find a way to work together. If you strive to build a shared mental model, you could improve things exponentially for your organization.

## A Useful Model of Work 

> “All models are wrong, but some are useful” - [George Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong)  

To ask the right questions and to understand how your investments help folks you'll need a model of work, or how effort is expended deliver value.

A simplistic way to think about it is how can you reduce the amount of effort that is required to deliver value.

For any given deliverable the work breaks into 3 main phases.

* Phase A
	* requirements gathering
	* technical design
	* alignment
	* project planning
* Phase B
	* Burning down the backlog
	* Discovery
	* Fixing Implementation bugs
* Phase C
	* Feature rollout
	* Bug fixing
	* long term maintenance 

As a core/platform team, it’s not helpful for you to do the work of other teams. You have to help the teams do the work. It's helpful to identify the most valuable place to make an impact that isn't _doing the work_.

Here is one potential model of a team's effort that is delivering value. The areas where you have the most influence are highlighted in yellow.

While this is overly general it's a useful model for how teams deliver value.

There are other models to consider as well. Like what happens before a team starts on delivery. But, you can choose to start anywhere, might as well start where most of your co-workers spend their time.

## Using A Model To Do Qualitative Analysis

Up till this point, I don’t feel like I’ve suggested anything out of the ordinary. Building a model of how folks deliver value, and then hypothesizing how you might make it better feels like the like work any core/platform team would do.

But, the next step from here is finding a way to measure your impact, not only on the teams you serve, but for the organization as a whole.

I’ll admit this part is highly speculative, but given a model, we should be able to start doing qualitative research with specific questions in mind. 

The goal is for you and your team to build a working mental model of how the teams you support deliver value to your customers. With a focus on speed, efficiency, and quality. You’ll want to work with engineers and other stakeholders in the value delivery chain.

Start by doing unstructured interviews. It’s likely you are already doing this informally anyway. You will start to understand the themes. What activities are teams doing that seem to lead to success? Are you finding shared blockers?

Once you have a rough model of work and any themes of success or friction. You’ll want to verify these by surveying your teams.

You can use the [Likert](https://www.simplypsychology.org/likert-scale.html) scale, combined with statements like, “When X I feel productive.”. Use statements and themes from your interviews. Allow for free text input as well, so you can continue to find themes you hadn't heard yet.

From your survey, you can validate how widely these themes affect other teams. 

From here you would either have more clarity, or more questions you can use to gain clarity. Rinse and repeat, until you have a clear understanding of the value delivery process, and the impediments. 

With this clarity, you should have a narrative that any stakeholder would be interested to hear. 

Now you’ll be able to measure impact by continuing to interview and run surveys.

For instance you can say, something along the lines of, 70% of our engineers report A is impacting their productivity. We hypothesize that by doing x, y, and z, we can reduce the impact A by 50% for all engineers. 

As you do the work to improve folks experience, your interviews and surveys should report that fewer folks report A as an impact. Thus you know that your team is making an impact on value delivery. 

Using qualitative analysis feels like a natural evolution for many senior engineers, especially if you spend your time already familiarizing your self with organization pain points.
