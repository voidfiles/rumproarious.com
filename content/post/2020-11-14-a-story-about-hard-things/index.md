Doing hard work, especially novel work, with others is *hard* and it's incredibly difficult to talk about. Us humans have a penchant for being nice and polite, which is lovely. It allows us to co-exist, mostly. We can stand in a crowed street and generally we all get where we are going. Even when we work in the same office or when we work on a project our penchant for nice and polite allows us to muddle through our work.

But, if you want to try and push it. If you want to increase your output, if you want to try something new or complex, as a team, you'll need more than nice and polite. They are the bedrock for everything else. You'll build on those.

So, why is it hard? Based on my experience and what I've read, it's hard because you have to _work with_ other humans. With, being the keyword. Not in the same place, not near, not before or after, but _with_. The sum of the team should be greater than each individual added together.

Surprisingly, working well as a team is not a given. 9 out of 10 times the outcome will be mediocre. Because mediocre is the default state of most work.

> "It's hard to make something that's interesting. It's really, really hard. It's like a law of nature, a law of aerodynamics, that anything that's written or *anything that's created wants to be mediocre*. The natural state of all writing is mediocrity" - Ira Glass (Creator/Host of This America Life)

It doesn't even matter how smart folks are. When you put a group of people together, and ask them to do something hard. It's never a forgone conclusion that they will work well together. Especially, especially, when the work is abstract. 

*And, all work with computers is abstract.*

FWIW, we build a ton of ways to get around this fact. There's a reason why frameworks and standard industry practices are used. If you work in a rails shop there's just a bunch of things you'll never have to talk about.

These industry norms and practices stop being valuable as you move up in seniority, because you're work is novel. By definition you shouldn't be working on solved problems.

This is something I think about a lot when I start work on a new team. It's something I struggle to communicate. Instead of trying the same thing over and over again, with the same result, I've started working on a visual story, maybe the start of a presentation that would explain the problem in simple yet stark way.

If you are reading this, I'm curious if think this communicates something of value. Feel free to email me, or DM me. (voidfiles@gmail.com - @voidfiles)
