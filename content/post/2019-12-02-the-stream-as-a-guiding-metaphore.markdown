I'm from 80s. I remember life before the Internet. In my experience, the biggest difference is the sense of abundance and decay. Pre-internet I felt a scarcity of information. Wired came once a month. When I had enough money I'd buy 2600 (it's hard to convince parents to subscribe to a "hackers" quarterly). Between publications, I'd dwell on the information. It stayed with me.

You could call this pre-stream. I had a scarcity of information, but it meant a lot to me.

Post internet exposure, I had sources of information that updated intra-daily. [Slashdot](https://slashdot.org/), [Kuro5hin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuro5hin) were my go to. The constant onslaught of information feed my burning desire for this information. At the same time it diminished how long I spent thinking about any single thing.

You could call this post-stream. I had an abundance of information, but it decayed quickly.

This was my default position for many years. I moved on from Slashdot to [Del.icio.us](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_(website)>), then [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news). Things continued to grow with RSS and Social Media.

In general, this was fine. Learn about the new things is intoxicating and sometimes I'd go deep them. This was the beginning of my career. Hacking on early versions of [PHP-Nuke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP-Nuke) to building sites using Python and Django. All things I found via the abundance of information, and then organically transitioned to using them.

I was able to ride that wave for a long time. Learn new thing X, incorporate it, get better, rinse repeat.

But, there came a time where I didn't want to only incorporate new things. I wanted to master them. I wanted to focus on long lasting value.

That's when the abundance and the decay were no longer paying off.

Around this time. I read an article "2013: The Year 'the Stream' Crested" by Alexis Madrigal [the-stream]. The article is pointed at "The Media", specifically on line publications at the time. But, it bundles together a bunch of good ideas. I like this quote in particular:

> The great irony is that we got what we wanted from the stream: a way to read and watch outside the editorial control of editors, old Yahoo-style cataloging, and Google bots. But when the order of the media cosmos was annihilated, freedom did not rush into the vacuum, but an emergent order with its own logic. We discovered that the stream introduced its own kinds of compulsions and controls. Faster! More! Faster! More! Faster! More!

This totally reflected my personal experience. I was seen! Besides perfectly describing an experience, it pointed to some possible solutions to manage the abundance and decay of the stream. Specifically another post: "Stock and Flow" by Robin Sloan [stock-and-flow]. Madrigals post quotes Sloans piece like so:

> Flow is the feed. It’s the posts and the tweets. It’s the stream of daily and sub-daily updates that reminds people you exist.
> Stock is the durable stuff. It’s the content you produce that’s as interesting in two months (or two years) as it is today. It’s what people discover via search. It’s what spreads slowly but surely, building fans over time.

It occurred to me at the time that the flow is going to flow. You can't fight it. You have to step out of it, as Frank Chimero says in "The Anthologists" [the-anthologists][the-anthologists-meta]:

> How do you balance the stream’s relentless push forward? You circle around, and step back into your own footprints. You find familiar places, look again, and pull the good things out of the past’s abyss.

Where as you don't need to fight the flow, the stream is gonna wash over you by default, stock is hard.

[the-anthologists-meta]: It was odd to me, but I couldn't find this article listed on Chimero's site anywhere. Something that was "stock" to me was gone. In and odd meta twist these posts all pushed me to start archiving posts that I felt were particularly important.
