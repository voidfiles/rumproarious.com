Gonna start out the month with a fun and simple one.

[MP3 Blogs and wget](http://www.veen.com/jeff/archives/000573.html) by Jeffrey Veen.

When I read this, I had a VPS, that I could barely keep running. I blindly ran the command in this post.

The next morning I found that I had downloaded almost 30 gigabytes of MP3s.

It forced me to learning about things about linux, and wget.

This was important, because I got one of my first tech jobs because I knew about wget.
