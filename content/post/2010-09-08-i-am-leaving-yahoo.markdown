I have spent the last 3 years, or so, working at Yahoo!, you must raise
your voice at the end of the hoo, and it has been awesome. The
opportunities to learn, and grow were huge, but it's time for me to move
on. In any organization you can pick it apart, and I have, but my move
isn't about that. If anything, it's about getting a variety of
experience.

That is why I am proud to say I am going to an awesome little company
called [Mixed Media Labs](https://mxml-blog-blog.tumblr.com/), and their
product [Picplz](https://web.archive.org/web/20100713033910/http://picplz.com/) ([more info
here](https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/20/how-andreessen-horowitz-fumbled-an-instagram-investment/)). I am excited to apply
what I have learned from building large websites, for millions of
people, to building fast, sleek mobile apps. It doesn't hurt that the
entire company sits in one space. I can't even imagine how refreshing
that will be.

Thank's Yahoo! don't let them keep you down.
