There will be commit messages. Many. Of. Them.

Your team will read them.
Your boss will read them.
Strangers will read them.
**You** will read them.

Future self is skeptical of present self.

You owe it to everyone to try and write better commit messages.

I'm not suggesting that I always do, it's a lofty goal, but here is [some](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) help:

{{< rawhtml >}}
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Separate subject from body with a blank line</li>
    <li>Limit the subject line to 50 characters</li>
    <li>Capitalize the subject line</li>
    <li>Do not end the subject line with a period</li>
    <li>Use the imperative mood in the subject line</ li>
    <li>Wrap the body at 72 characters</li>
    <li>Use the body to explain what and why vs. how</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

Please do read the whole post though.
