After a long hiatus, David and I are bringing the StaffEng podcast back. And I'm more excited about this than I've been about almost anything in my career.

When we started the podcast back in 2021, we were exploring what it meant to be a Staff-plus engineer. We talked to practitioners about setting technical direction, mentorship, sponsorship, and all the things that set senior individual contributors apart. Those conversations were valuable, and I learned a tremendous amount from our guests.

But something has changed. The work itself has changed. And I couldn't stay quiet about it.

Over the last year or so, I've watched AI transform how I work in ways I didn't anticipate. Not the hype-cycle AI of breathless predictions and vaporware demos. The real, practical, day-to-day experience of using these tools to build software. The kind of transformation that sneaks up on you until one day you realize you're working differently than you were six months ago.

I'm not talking about replacing engineers. I'm talking about amplifying what we can do. The leverage has shifted. Problems that used to take me a week of context-switching and research now collapse into focused sessions where I can actually think about the architecture instead of getting lost in implementation details. The tedious parts of the job — the boilerplate, the lookup, the "I know this exists somewhere" searches — those are receding. What's left is the interesting stuff. The judgment calls. The trade-offs. The human decisions that actually matter.

This is why we're rebooting the podcast with a specific focus: practitioners using AI to deliver valuable outcomes, with specific examples.

Not thought leaders speculating about the future. Not researchers publishing papers. Practitioners. People doing the work. People who can tell you exactly what they built, how they built it, and what they learned along the way.

I want to know: How are Staff-plus engineers integrating these tools into their workflows? What's actually working? What's hype and what's substance? How do you think about AI when you're setting technical direction for a team or an organization? How do you mentor engineers in a world where the tools are changing this fast?

These are the questions I'm sitting with, and I suspect I'm not alone. The conversations David and I have been having offline have been some of the most energizing discussions about technology I've had in years. We want to bring those conversations to you.

If you're a Staff-plus engineer who's been using AI to ship real things, I want to talk to you. If you're figuring out how to lead teams through this transition, I want to hear your story. If you've found something that works — or discovered something that definitely doesn't — those are exactly the kinds of insights we're looking for.

New episodes are in production. We're coming back, and I can't wait to share what we're learning.
