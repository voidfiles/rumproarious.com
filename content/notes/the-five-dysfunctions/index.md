## Main gist
### The 5 Dysfunctions
* Lack of trust
	* Team members don't trust others show vulnerability, which means individuals won't
	* This is important because if you aren't vulnerable, it's hard to get to the heart of the matter
	* This relates to conflict, because constructive conflict is about making things better
* Fear of conflict
	* If you can't have constructive conflict you can't get alignment and buy in 
	* This is important for commitment
* Lack of commitment
	* If you aren't bought in, you won't follow through
* Inability to hold people accountability
	* If we can't have constructive conflict around our commitments its hard to ensure that the team is working towards a shared goal
* Inattention to results
	* When folks find it hard to work to a shared goal and have others account for their actions they tend to focus on their own goals over the team goals.

"this section is designed to provide a clear, concise, and practical guide to using the Five Dysfunctions Model to improve your team. Good luck."

#### An overview of the model 
* Genuine teamwork is elusive
* It doesn't happen because they have the 5 dysfunctions
* The issues aren't separate, but interlated

The dysfunctions are

1. Absence of trust: Stems from the unwillingness to be vulnerable within the group. Lack of openness 
2. Fear of conflict: without trust you can't have difficult conversations
3. Lack of commitment: It's hard to get buy in if folks haven't had open and honest conversations
4. Avoidance of accountability: Because theres no clear commitments its hard to hold everyone accountable
5. Inattention to results: When you don't have a clear actionable plan to achieve a result as team it might be easier to focus on individual results.

Another way to look at it, in order to have a truly cohesive team you need.

1. To trust one another
2. To engage in unfiltered conflict around ideas
3. Commit to decisions and plans of action 
4. Hold one another accountable for delivering against those plans
5. Docs on the achievement of collective result

#### Team Assesment
* Provides a tool to asses your team

#### Understanding and overcoming the five dysfunctions

##### Dysfunction 1: Absence of trust

###### What does it look like

* Trust is important, but the word is used and missed 
* In terms of team building. Trust means:

	* There is no reason to be protective or careful around the group
* Which is different the saying that folks have produced good work in the past and you trust they will continue to do it.
* This kind of trust requires folks to be be vulnerable
	* They might have some weakness's that need help
	* There might be a skill gap that can be closed
	* They might not communicate well
	* They will make mistakes
	* They might ask for help
* If we don't trust our team it's hard for us to show vulnerability 
* People instictintivley to hide these kinds of things 

###### How to overcome

Constructive conflict allows folks to get on the same page about what matters. Without conflict it can be hard to truly commit to the plan

##### Dysfunction 3: Lack of Commitment 

* Commitment is:
	* Clarity
	* Buy In

*  Contributing factors to lack of commitment
	* Consensus:
		* Complete agreement isn't always possible
		* Sometimes folks just want to be heard and considered
		* When it's not possible due to an impasse the leader makes the call
	* Certainty:
		* Create a clear course of action, even if they may be wrong
		* A decision is better then no decision
		* Better to make a bold decisions and be wrong, and also be willing to make a change. Then to waffle

* Waffling at the executive level creates deep conflict in their teams who then have to deal with lack of buy in

* A team that fails to commit :
	• Creates ambiguity among the team about direction and priorities
	• Watches windows of opportunity close due to excessive analysis and unnecessary delay

	* In a low-risk situation
	* having a good discussion, but don't analyze, instead commit
	* Recognize, and evaluate how it worked out

###### The Role of the Leader

Leader needs to be cool making designs that can turn out to be wrong

###### Connection to Dysfunction 4
In order to hold everyone accountable there needs to be a clear sense of what was expected.

##### Dysfunction 4: Avoidance of Accountability 
Accountability is the willingness of team members to call their peers on performance or behaviors that might hurt the team.

The dysfunction is when members don't call each other on behavior and a tendency to avoid difficult conversations.

Hard to do, folks who are close are can be harder to call folks out.

Peer pressure could help here.

	• Creates resentment among team members who have different standards of performance
	• Encourages mediocrity
	• Misses deadlines and key deliverables
	• Places an undue burden on the team leader as the sole source of discipline

###### The Role of the Leaders
Let team members hold teacher other accountable, instead of the leader. You must be willing to make hard decisions.

######  Connections to Dysfunction 5
If teams cannot hold each other accountable they will turn away from shared goals and instead focus on personal goals.

##### Dysfunction 5: Inattention to Results

"The tendency of members to care about something other then the collective goals of the group"

The ability to focus on specific objects and clearly defined objects is a requirement for a high performing team.

This doesn't just have to be financial stuff, anything that is outcome based. 

The organization must make the goals, and sub goals clear so teams can hold them selves accountable.

What do teams focus on when they aren't focusing on shared goals?

* Team status: Being apart of the team is the most important thing
* Individual Status: Focusing on how to improve there station over the team

Some teams just aren't focused on results. They are consumed by achieve the results.

* A team that is not focused on results ...
	• Stagnates/fails to grow
	• Rarely defeats competitors
	• Loses achievement-oriented employees
	• Encourages team members to focus on their own careers and individual goals
	• Is easily distracted
* A team that focuses on collective results ...
	• Retains achievement-oriented employees
	• Minimizes individualistic behavior
	• Enjoys success and suffers failure acutely
	• Benefits from individuals who subjugate their own goals/interests for the good of the team
	• avoids distractions

* Tools
	* Public Declaration of Results
		* Making things public makes them clear 
		* Teams willing to commit set them selves up for success 
	* Results-Based Rewards: 
		* Reward things that produce results
		

###### The role of a Leader

Leader must set the tone of deliver results. They must reward results.
